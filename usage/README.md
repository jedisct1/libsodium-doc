# Usage

```c
#include <sodium.h>

int main(void)
{
    if (sodium_init() == -1) {
        return 1;
    }
    ...
}
```

`sodium.h` is the only header that has to be included.

The library is called `sodium` \(use `-lsodium` to link it\), and proper
compilation/linker flags can be obtained using `pkg-config` on systems where it
is available:

```bash
CFLAGS=$(pkg-config --cflags libsodium)
LDFLAGS=$(pkg-config --libs libsodium)
```

For static linking, Visual Studio users should define `SODIUM_STATIC=1` and
`SODIUM_EXPORT=`. This is not required on other platforms.

Projects using CMake can include the
[Findsodium.cmake](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fizz/blob/master/fizz/cmake/FindSodium.cmake)
file from the Facebook Fizz project in order to detect and link the library.

`sodium_init()` initializes the library and should be called before any other
function provided by Sodium. It is safe to call this function more
than once and from different threads -- subsequent calls won't have any effects.

After this function returns, all of the other functions provided by Sodium will
be thread-safe.

`sodium_init()` doesn't perform any memory allocations. However, on Unix
systems, it may open `/dev/urandom` and keep the descriptor open, so that the
device remains accessible after a `chroot()` call.

Multiple calls to `sodium_init()` do not cause additional descriptors to be
opened.

`sodium_init()` returns `0` on success, `-1` on failure, and `1` if the library
had already been initialized.

Before returning, the function ensures that the system's random number generator
has been properly seeded.

## sodium_init() stalling on Linux

On some Linux systems, this may take some time, especially when called right
after a reboot of the system. That issue has been reported on Digital Ocean
virtual machines as well as on Scaleway ARM instances.

This can be confirmed with the following command:

```sh
cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
```

If the command returns `0` or a very low number \(&lt; `160`\), and you are not
running an obsolete kernel, this is very likely to be the case.

In a virtualized environment, make sure that the `virtio-rng` interface is
available. If this is a cloud service and the hypervisor settings are out of
your reach, consider switching to a different service.

On a bare-metal host such as Scaleway instances, a possible workaround is to
install the `rng-tools` package:

```sh
apt-get install rng-tools
```

And check the value of `/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail` again. If the
value didn't go any higher, install `haveged`:

```sh
apt-get install haveged
```

Haveged should only be used as a very last resort. It hasn't received any
updates for 10+ years, and shouldn't be trusted as a single entropy source,
especially on virtualized environments.

[Jitterentropy](https://github.com/smuellerDD/jitterentropy-rngd) is a better
alternative, but most Linux distributions don't offer it as an installable
package yet.

Applications can warn users about the Linux RNG not being seeded before calling
`sodium_init()` using code similar to the following:

```c
#if defined(__linux__)
# include <fcntl.h>
# include <unistd.h>
# include <sys/ioctl.h>
# include <linux/random.h>
#endif
// ...
#if defined(__linux__) && defined(RNDGETENTCNT)
int fd;
int c;

if ((fd = open("/dev/random", O_RDONLY)) != -1) {
    if (ioctl(fd, RNDGETENTCNT, &c) == 0 && c < 160) {
        fputs("This system doesn't provide enough entropy to quickly generate high-quality random numbers.\n"
              "Installing the rng-utils/rng-tools, jitterentropy or haveged packages may help.\n"
              "On virtualized Linux environments, also consider using virtio-rng.\n"
              "The service will not start until enough entropy has been collected.\n", stderr);
    }
    (void) close(fd);
}
#endif
```
