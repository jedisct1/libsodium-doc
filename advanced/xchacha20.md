# XChaCha20

XChaCha20 is a variant of ChaCha20 with an extended nonce, allowing random
nonces to be safe.

XChaCha20 doesn't require any lookup tables and avoids the possibility of timing
attacks.

Internally, XChaCha20 works like a block cipher used in counter mode. It uses
the HChaCha20 hash function to derive a subkey and a subnonce from the original
key and extended nonce, and a dedicated 64-bit block counter to avoid
incrementing the nonce after each block.

XChaCha20 is generally recommended over plain ChaCha20 due to its extended nonce
size, and its comparable performance. However, XChaCha20 is currently not widely
implemented outside the libsodium library, due to the absence of formal
specification.

## Usage

```c
int crypto_stream_xchacha20(unsigned char *c, unsigned long long clen,
                            const unsigned char *n, const unsigned char *k);
```

The `crypto_stream_xchacha20()` function stores `clen` pseudo random bytes into
`c` using a nonce `n` (`crypto_stream_xchacha20_NONCEBYTES` bytes) and a secret
key `k` (`crypto_stream_xchacha20_KEYBYTES` bytes).

The function always returns `0`.

```c
int crypto_stream_xchacha20_xor(unsigned char *c, const unsigned char *m,
                                unsigned long long mlen, const unsigned char *n,
                                const unsigned char *k);
```

The `crypto_stream_xchacha20_xor()` function encrypts a message `m` of length
`mlen` using a nonce `n` (`crypto_stream_xchacha20_NONCEBYTES` bytes) and a
secret key `k` (`crypto_stream_xchacha20_KEYBYTES` bytes).

The ciphertext is put into `c`. The ciphertext is the message combined with the
output of the stream cipher using the XOR operation, and doesn't include any
authentication tag.

`m` and `c` can point to the same address (in-place encryption/decryption). If
they don't, the regions should not overlap.

The function always returns `0`.

```c
int crypto_stream_xchacha20_xor_ic(unsigned char *c, const unsigned char *m,
                                   unsigned long long mlen,
                                   const unsigned char *n, uint64_t ic,
                                   const unsigned char *k);
```

The `crypto_stream_xchacha20_xor_ic()` function is similar to
`crypto_stream_xchacha20_xor()` but adds the ability to set the initial value of
the block counter to a non-zero value, `ic`.

This permits direct access to any block without having to compute the previous
ones.

`m` and `c` can point to the same address (in-place encryption/decryption). If
they don't, the regions should not overlap.

The function always returns `0`.

```c
void crypto_stream_xchacha20_keygen(unsigned char k[crypto_stream_xchacha20_KEYBYTES]);
```

This helper function introduced in libsodium 1.0.12 creates a random key `k`.

It is equivalent to calling `randombytes_buf()` but improves code clarity and
can prevent misuse by ensuring that the provided key length is always be
correct.

## Constants

* `crypto_stream_xchacha20_KEYBYTES`
* `crypto_stream_xchacha20_NONCEBYTES`

## Notes

Unlike plain ChaCha20, the nonce is 192 bits long, so that generating a random
nonce for every message is safe. If the output of the PRNG is indistinguishable
from random data, the probability for a collision to happen is negligible.

XChaCha20 was implemented in libsodium 1.0.12.
